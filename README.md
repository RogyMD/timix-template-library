# Timix Template Library

**A library of Timix templates to help you focus, move, cook, rest, and play.**

Timix templates are ready-made sessions designed for everything from studying and workouts to cooking and board games.  
Use them as they are, customize them, or create your own to fit your life and rhythm.
If you can't find a template that suits your needs, you can easily create your own templates with help of [TimixGPT](https://rogy.app/timixgpt).

## How to Use

1. Browse the category folders.
2. Find a timer that fits your needs.
3. Download the `.cdowntmpl` file.  
   <img src="download_template.jpeg" alt="How to download a file" width="200"/>
4. Open the file in Timix and import it.

> 💡 If you're downloading on iPhone or iPad, we recommend using [Brave Browser](https://apps.apple.com/app/brave-browser-search-engine/id1052879175) (or another browser) instead of Safari. Safari may add a `.txt` extension to `.cdowntmpl` files.

That's it — you're ready to go.
